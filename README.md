# AnimatedLandscape

Welcome to my animated landscape ðŸ™‚

This is just something I put together to show the differences between Animations, Transitions and Transformations. 

There's a cheeky animation on page load, the rest of the scene is interactive by hover or clicks! 

The project is built in HTML, CSS and jQuery.
