# AnimatedLandscape

Welcome to my animated landscape ðŸ™‚

This is just something I put together to show the differences between Animations, Transitions and Transforming. 

The project is built in HTML, CSS and jQuery. 

Firstly, on initial page load there is a fun animation for you to enjoy! ðŸ˜Š <br>

Secondly, if you hover over the clouds there's a couple that may change using transform or transition..

Thirdly, clicking the sun or moon will trigger a sunset or sunrise, including a few twinkly stars.. 

Lastly, careful of the cows, they may get a little spooked if you hover over them!
